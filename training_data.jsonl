Be sure to brush all areas of your Shih-Tzu's coat, including the belly, legs, and tail.\n\n**Bathing:** Shih-Tzus should be bathed every 1-2 weeks with a gentle shampoo and conditioner designed for dogs.

Use a dog nail clipper to trim your Shih-Tzu's nails. Be careful not to cut the nails too short, as this can be painful for your Shih-Tzu.\n\n**Ear cleaning:** Shih-Tzus' ears should be cleaned regularly to prevent infection.
